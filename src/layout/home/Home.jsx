        My name is Dylan, and I am a software engineer.  
        I started out working as an industrial technician where I had to complete tasks in a timely manner to guarantee there was no work stoppage 
        and followed the plantâ€™s schedules.  I knew that I wanted more out of my career, so I started to look at what my interests were.  
        I have always loved working with computers, and I have always been interested in the way that things work.

        When attending college, I took an intro to C++ course where I found my passion for programming.  
        I finished out my degree and I have since enrolled in a full-stack software engineering boot camp that I am currently a week away from completing.  
        In this boot camp, I have learned the common practices of front-end and back-end programming, and I can make full-stack CRUD programs.
